# Development Phases

> No application code before this documentation system is complete and reviewed by the team.

1. **Phase 0 — Documentation (current)**: architecture, contracts, design system, test plan defined
2. **Phase 1 — Foundations**: repo setup, env handling, API client scaffolding, auth flow agreed
3. **Phase 2 — Public site**: pages, components, real API integration, loading/empty/error states
4. **Phase 3 — Admin dashboard**: auth guard, CRUD modules, publish toggles, SEO controls
5. **Phase 4 — AI RAG chat UI**: integration with backend RAG service, all scenarios
6. **Phase 5 — Contact/SMTP**: form, validation, spam protection, end-to-end email test
7. **Phase 6 — Hardening**: security review, a11y pass, SEO pass, performance pass
8. **Phase 7 — Deployment & demo prep**: deploy, submission checklist, jury demo rehearsal

Each phase ends with its checklist green before moving on.

## Implementation Notes � Phase 1 (actual decisions)

- Framework: **Next.js 16 (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS v4** � this resolves the technology "TEAM DECISION / TO BE DECIDED" in this document. Package manager: npm. App lives in `pureblend-web/`.
- Tailwind v4 CSS-first tokens in `src/app/globals.css` (`@theme`): brand, accent, neutral, semantic colors, radius (sm/md/lg/pill), shadows (card/raised/modal), motion tokens, breakpoints mapped to strategy (sm=640, md=1024, lg=1280, xl=1536).
- Implemented all public routes + 404 + admin shell routes (see `src/app`); all admin module pages are `AdminModuleShell` placeholders with honest empty states (no fake CRUD).
- API boundary: `src/lib/api/client.ts` (`apiRequest`), `types.ts`, `endpoints.ts`. No components call fetch directly. Endpoints beyond the contract are not invented; services are TODO until backend finalizes.
- State: local component state only (chat messages, form, mobile nav). No global store introduced � matches strategy doc.
- Chat is UI-only calling `POST /api/chat`; no keys in client.
- Fixtures in `src/data/dev-fixtures.ts` are clearly marked dev-only; production pages will consume services later.
- SEO: `src/lib/metadata.ts` `pageMetadata()` helper per page; dynamic product metadata via `generateMetadata` (now from fixtures; TODO switch to API).
- A11y: skip link, semantic landmarks, modal focus handling, accordion aria, focus-visible styles, reduced-motion CSS, honeypot input.
- Build/typecheck/eslint pass; routes smoke-tested (all 200 except unknown product slug and unknown URL ? 404).
- Sensitive items never client-side: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` + `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` only.

Why the folder structure is slightly simpler than the original proposal: Next.js App Router colocates routes under `src/app`, and components/types/lib follow the documented separation (`components/ui|layout|marketing|chat|admin|forms`, `lib/api`, `data`) without an additional `features/` layer � to be reintroduced if feature complexity warrants it.

## Implementation Notes — Phase 2 (actual decisions)

- Project migrated from `pureblend-web/` into the repository root — the repo root is now the active project.
- Homepage assembled from documented sections only: Hero, About intro, Why PureBlend, Product showcase, Offers, AI assistant CTA, Contact CTA. No invented certifications/partners/statistics.
- Products listing: `ProductsBrowser` client component adds search + category filter over props-injected data (fixtures now; API later). Empty/no-match/error states implemented.
- Product detail: breadcrumb, gallery slot (aspect-ratio, lazy/eager image component), specifications `<dl>`, "Request specifications" CTA, related products by category, `generateMetadata` uses product SEO fields when present.
- Offers page: `OfferSection`/`OfferCard` with validity date display and empty state. No fake discount math.
- FAQs: accessible accordion (aria-expanded/controls/region, keyboard operable) with loading/empty/error patterns ready at the page level.
- Contact: validated form (name/email/subject/message + hidden honeypot), per-field errors, submit-disable, success/error feedback; posts to `POST /api/contact` — SMTP wiring deferred to backend phase.
- Privacy/Terms: readable long-form layout with clear placeholder copy marked for CMS replacement.
- Footer: config-driven social links (`config.socials`) — rendered only when real URLs are provided, per organizer rule about working social links.
- 404 page implemented and verified for unknown routes and unknown product slugs.
- SEO applied to every public page via `pageMetadata()` (title, description, canonical, Open Graph).
- Image strategy: `next/image`, aspect-ratio containers, object-cover, explicit sizes, priority only for hero, dev SVG placeholder asset.
- Responsive QA performed by code review + build; visual device testing still needs a human pass at 320px–1920px.
- All Phase 2 routes verified on the production server: pages return 200, unknown product and unknown URL return the custom 404.
- `tsc --noEmit` = 0, eslint clean, `next build` succeeds from the repository root.


## Implementation Notes — Phase 3 (frontend data/API integration layer)

- Centralized API layer in `src/lib/api/`: `client.ts` (`apiRequest` with timeout via `AbortSignal.timeout`, query-param builder, auth-token hook, network-error/timeout/malformed-response normalization to `ApiError`), `types.ts` (entities mirroring `/docs/05-backend-integration` + `/docs/07-database`), `endpoints.ts` (all documented endpoint paths — no invented routes), `services.ts` (`getProducts`, `getProductBySlug`, `getBanners`, `getOffers`, `getFaqs`, `sendChatMessage`, `submitContact`), `index.ts` barrel.
- UI never calls `fetch` directly; ContactForm and ChatWindow now use services.
- Environment strategy: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK_DATA`. Defaults to REAL API (production-safe). `.env.development` enables mocks locally; `.env.production` forces `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK_DATA=false`. `.env.example` contains placeholders only — no secrets. `.gitignore` allows committing `.env.example` / `.env.development` / `.env.production`.
- Mock strategy: `src/mocks/dev-fixtures.ts` (moved from `src/data/`), clearly marked DEVELOPMENT ONLY; services branch on `config.useMockData`. Production never renders fixtures. No fake admin CRUD, no fake SMTP success, no fake RAG answers.
- Error handling: every public page resolves its fetch in try/catch and renders `ErrorState` on failure; no raw framework errors reach users; `ApiError` never leaks stack traces or internal details.
- `/products`, `/products/[slug]`, `/offers`, `/faqs`, homepage sections all consume services. Related-products and page metadata degrade gracefully. Product SEO title/description fall back when absent.
- Chatbot boundary preserved: frontend posts only to `POST /api/chat`; no AI provider calls, no keys in client code.
- React ESLint rule `react-hooks/error-boundaries` prohibits JSX construction inside try/catch — pages were refactored to fetch-then-render. `tsc --noEmit` = 0, eslint clean, `next build` succeeds, dev-server smoke test passes with fixtures (mock mode).
- Performance: parallel `Promise.allSettled` fetches on homepage (no waterfalls), request dedupe map in services, `next/image` sizes set, loading/error/empty states retained.

Backend-team dependencies (documented in `/docs/05-backend-integration`): products/banners/offers/faqs list+detail endpoints, content endpoints, `/api/contact` (SMTP), `/api/chat` (RAG), auth endpoints, standard error shape compliance.


## Implementation Notes — Phase 4 (Admin Dashboard frontend)

- Admin routes: `/admin` (overview), `/admin/login`, `/admin/products`, `/admin/banners`, `/admin/offers`, `/admin/faqs`, `/admin/content`, `/admin/seo`. Admin detail/edit-as-page routes were not needed because create/edit happens in accessible modals via the shared `EntityManager`.
- New components: `AdminGuard` (UX session check via `GET /api/auth/me`, redirect to login on failure — not the security boundary), `EntityManager` (generic CRUD: search, table, create/edit modal, delete confirmation modal, status toggle, loading/error/empty, skeletons), `TableSkeleton`.
- Admin CRUD flows: create/edit modal → validation → loading button → service → list refresh; delete → confirmation → processing state → error/success via list refresh; publish/activate toggle with busy state and label from the entity's real flag.
- Auth boundary: `admin.login/logout/getMe` services call `POST /api/auth/login`, `POST /api/auth/logout`, `GET /api/auth/me` through the Phase 3 API layer. In mock mode (`NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK_DATA=true`) they return a dev user so the dashboard is demoable locally; production mode enforces real session flow.
- Mock mode admin CRUD echoes inputs (development only) — no fake persistence, no fake production success. Production uses the documented endpoints only.
- Loading/empty/error states present on every admin module; no fake sample records in empty states.
- No raw fetch in components — all via `admin` services namespace under `src/lib/api/admin.ts`.
- Responsive: sidebar becomes a horizontally scrollable nav on mobile, content stacks, modals are centered/full-width on small screens, tables scroll horizontally.
- A11y: labels on all fields, role=alert on errors, modal Escape/backdrop close and initial focus, buttons have accessible names.
- Verification: `tsc --noEmit` = 0, eslint clean, `next build` succeeds, all admin routes + `/` smoke-tested 200 on the dev server.


## Implementation Notes � Phase 5 (AI RAG chatbot frontend)

- ChatWindow rewritten: welcome message + suggested questions (generic, no invented facts), per-message sources indicator only when the backend returns `sources`, clear-conversation action, Escape-to-close, focus input on open and after send, maxLength 500, `aria-live` message region, whitespace-pre-wrap rendering of plain text (no HTML injection), loading spinner labeled "searching PureBlend information".
- Error UX maps `ApiError.code` to friendly messages: `RATE_LIMITED` ? "too quickly", `NETWORK_ERROR`/`TIMEOUT` ? connection message, everything else ? generic unavailable. No stack traces/URLs/providers leaked.
- ChatLauncher lazy-loads ChatWindow via `next/dynamic` (ssr:false) to keep initial page JS small.
- `sendChatMessage` mock mode no longer fabricates answers � it returns an explicit "backend not connected" notice (development only).
- Grounding rules honored: no invented answers, no general-purpose assistant behavior, sources shown only when the contract provides them, no fake citations, no direct AI provider calls, no API keys in client code.
- Contract: `POST /api/chat` with `{ message, conversationId? }` ? `{ reply, conversationId, sources? }`. Unknown contract gaps are documented as backend-team dependencies rather than invented fields.


## Implementation Notes — Phase 6 (SEO / a11y / performance / security hardening)

- SEO: `metadataBase` set on root layout; per-page titles/descriptions/canonical/OG already in place; `/robots.txt` and `/sitemap.xml` now generated via `src/app/robots.ts` and `src/app/sitemap.ts`; admin tree marked `noindex,nofollow`; custom 404 rendered for unknown routes and product slugs.
- Error boundaries: `src/app/error.tsx` (public) and `src/app/admin/error.tsx` — professional message, retry + home actions, no stack traces, development console logging only.
- Accessibility: reviewed focus-visible styles, labels, aria-live regions, modal focus, FAQ accordion semantics — already implemented in Phases 1–5; no regressions introduced.
- Performance: chatbot lazy via `next/dynamic` (Phase 5); images use `next/image` with explicit sizes; font `display: swap`; parallel homepage fetches; in-request service dedupe.
- Security: no secrets in repo; env files placeholder-only; `.gitignore` allows committing only the placeholder env files; no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` anywhere.
- Verification: `tsc --noEmit` = 0, eslint clean, `next build` succeeds, `/robots.txt` + `/sitemap.xml` routes generated.
- Dependency audit: no new dependencies added in Phase 6; dependency list reviewed (next, react, tailwind, eslint, typescript, types only).


## Implementation Notes — Phase 8 (Contact + SMTP)

- New server-side route handler: `src/app/api/contact/route.ts` (Next.js App Router). It is the same-origin endpoint the Phase 3 service posts to (`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` is now empty → relative URL).
- Server validation: required name/subject, email regex, length caps (name 120, email 200, subject 200, message 5000, min 10), 400 on malformed JSON.
- Anti-spam: honeypot field (bots get a fake 200, no email sent) + per-IP in-memory rate limit (5 per 10 minutes → 429 RATE_LIMITED). Documented limitation: per-instance memory only.
- SMTP: nodemailer, config from server-only env (`SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASSWORD`, `SMTP_FROM`, `CONTACT_RECIPIENT`). Missing config → 503 safe message; delivery failure → 502 safe message. No credentials in client bundles or repo.
- Email safety: plain-text + escaped HTML body; `replyTo`/subject header values stripped of CR/LF to prevent header injection; no arbitrary HTML from user input.
- Frontend form already matched the contract (name/email/subject/message/honeypot) with success/error/loading states and submit-disable — validated against the endpoint.
- Test results (production server): valid submission → 503 (SMTP intentionally unconfigured in test), honeypot → 200 without side effects, invalid email → 422, short message → 422. Real inbox delivery requires real SMTP credentials — NOT claimed complete until actually tested with them.
- Env files updated: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` emptied in `.env.development`/`.env.production`; SMTP placeholders appended to `.env.example`.


## Implementation Notes — Phase 9 (Security audit & hardening)

- XSS: no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` anywhere; all dynamic content rendered as text; chatbot replies rendered as plain text with pre-wrap; email HTML body escaped.
- Security headers added in `next.config.ts`: X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options DENY, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy, and a conservative CSP (`default-src 'self'`, `frame-ancestors 'none'`, `form-action 'self'`; `script-src 'unsafe-inline'` retained because Next.js hydration requires it — documented trade-off).
- Secret audit: `git grep` for password/secret/api-key/token/smtp/database_url across tracked files — only placeholders and docs found; `.env.local` / real credential files are gitignored; only placeholder env files are tracked.
- Dependency audit: `npm audit` — 5 high-severity findings remain, all inside the dev-only ESLint chain (`micromatch`/`fast-glob` via `eslint-config-next`). Fixing requires `--force` major bumps, which was NOT applied to avoid breaking Next's pinned ESLint integration. Documented as accepted dev-only risk; not shipped to production runtime.
- Rate limiting: contact endpoint implements per-IP limit (5/10min); login/chat rate limits remain backend-team responsibility (documented dependency).
- Error security: route handler returns safe generic messages for 400/422/429/502/503; SMTP/network internals only logged server-side.
- Auth/authorization: frontend guard + backend-boundary documented; no claims of backend security from the frontend side.
- CORS: same-origin architecture (API routes in the Next app) removes the CORS surface for contact; remaining cross-origin backend endpoints default to same-origin relative calls.
- Upload security: no upload endpoint exists yet — dependency documented; frontend will validate type/size only, backend remains authoritative.
- RAG: no prompt-editing surface, plain-text rendering, no provider keys in client, unsupported-question behavior enforced by contract.
- Verified: `tsc --noEmit` = 0, eslint clean, production build succeeds with new headers config.


## Implementation Notes — Phase 10 (Deployment readiness reality check)

- Verified locally: production build succeeds (`next build`), typecheck = 0, eslint clean, dev smoke tests previously passed.
- NOT done in this workspace and marked BLOCKED: live deployment, real SMTP delivery, RAG in production, database provisioning, admin-account provisioning, custom domain/HTTPS, responsive pass on a deployed URL. These require hosting/provider credentials and the backend teammate's API.
- Reproducibility documented below in `/docs/12-deployment/deployment-checklist.md` (existing) — install `npm ci`, configure `.env` from `.env.example`, `npm run build`, `npm start` behind HTTPS.
- Credential handoff: jury admin credentials and real SMTP/RAG/DB secrets must be delivered through the official submission channel, never committed.
