## Implementation Notes — Phase 8 (Contact + SMTP)

- New server-side route handler: `src/app/api/contact/route.ts` (Next.js App Router). It is the same-origin endpoint the Phase 3 service posts to (`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` is now empty → relative URL).
- Server validation: required name/subject, email regex, length caps (name 120, email 200, subject 200, message 5000, min 10), 400 on malformed JSON.
- Anti-spam: honeypot field (bots get a fake 200, no email sent) + per-IP in-memory rate limit (5 per 10 minutes → 429 RATE_LIMITED). Documented limitation: per-instance memory only.
- SMTP: nodemailer, config from server-only env (`SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASSWORD`, `SMTP_FROM`, `CONTACT_RECIPIENT`). Missing config → 503 safe message; delivery failure → 502 safe message. No credentials in client bundles or repo.
- Email safety: plain-text + escaped HTML body; `replyTo`/subject header values stripped of CR/LF to prevent header injection; no arbitrary HTML from user input.
- Frontend form already matched the contract (name/email/subject/message/honeypot) with success/error/loading states and submit-disable — validated against the endpoint.
- Test results (production server): valid submission → 503 (SMTP intentionally unconfigured in test), honeypot → 200 without side effects, invalid email → 422, short message → 422. Real inbox delivery requires real SMTP credentials — NOT claimed complete until actually tested with them.
- Env files updated: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` emptied in `.env.development`/`.env.production`; SMTP placeholders appended to `.env.example`.
